Each week your project must meet a list of requirements in order to track progress. Think of this as a weekly rubric. This week you must complete the following project requirements:

Setup your project repository. Make sure you set it to a public repository so that others can see your repository.
Create a README.md markdown file inside your new repository to document the technical details of your project.
Project Overview - This section of your README should contain the description of your project, features, and functionality.
Prerequisites - This section of your README file should list out all of the software requirements your project needs to run (E.g browser version, NodeJS version, etc)
Getting Started - The Getting Started section of any README file normally contains all of the instructions for a developer to get a working version of your project up and running.
Links - This section of your README contains a list of important links such as local build URLs such as localhost:3000, staging links, etc.
Define all of your project milestones using GitHub. You can setup your milestones whichever way you would like.
Create your issues/tickets in your repository. Again, this is a project class so you can setup your tickets however you would like to. Just make sure you are defining clear goals & tasks for all 4 weeks.
Create your backend API that loads in your environment variables from a ".env" file.
A good example of a complete README.md file can be found in my public GitHub repository template for this class called jworkman/pp3-spotify-template.

If you have completed the 5 tasks outlined above then you have completed all of the requirements for week 1.
